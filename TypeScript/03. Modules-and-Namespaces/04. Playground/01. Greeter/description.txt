Create a namespace Greeter, that exports a generic interface Greeting. 
The interface must support the following two declarations:
 - introduction()
 - sayGoodbye(name) – the name is of the generic type

In a new file create class Person which implements the Greeter 
    interface and receives two private properties from the 
    constructor: name (a string) and age (a number) and add the 
    following logic to the methods:
 - introduction() – returns a string in the following format: 
    "My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
 - sayGoodbye(name) – returns a string in the following format: 
    "Dear {name}, it was a pleasure meeting you!"
