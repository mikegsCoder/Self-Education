Create a Family class with public property family which must be set
to empty array through the constructor.
The class must support 2 methods: a method for adding members to the
family array â€“ addNewMember(member) which is tuple of string and number
which represents the name and the age of each member and a method
oldestMember() which returns the oldest member in the family in the
following format: "The oldest member is {name} and he is {age} years old."
