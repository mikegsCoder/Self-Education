/*
Create a Family class with public property family which must be set 
to empty array through the constructor. 
The class must support 2 methods: a method for adding members to the 
family array â€“ addNewMember(member) which is tuple of string and number 
which represents the name and the age of each member and a method 
oldestMember() which returns the oldest member in the family in the 
following format: "The oldest member is {name} and he is {age} years old."
*/

// ---------- solution 1 ----------
type Member = [string, number];

class Family1 {
  public family: Member[];

  constructor(family: Member[] = []) {
    this.family = family
  }

  addNewMember(value: Member) {
    this.family.push(value);
