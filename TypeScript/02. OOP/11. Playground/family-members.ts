/*
Create a Family class with public property family which must be set 
to empty array through the constructor. 
The class must support 2 methods: a method for adding members to the 
family array â€“ addNewMember(member) which is tuple of string and number 
which represents the name and the age of each member and a method 
oldestMember() which returns the oldest member in the family in the 
following format: "The oldest member is {name} and he is {age} years old."
