Create a function cityTaxes(). It should receive a city's name 
(string), population (number) and treasury (number) as arguments. 
You will need to set as properties of an object and return the object. 
In addition to the input parameters, the object must have a property 
taxRate with an initial value of 10, and three methods for managing 
the city:
 - collectTaxes() - increase the treasury by  population * taxRate
 - applyGrowth(percentage) - increase the population by the given 
    percentage
 - applyRecession(percentage) - Decrease the treasury by the given 
    percentage
Round down the values after each calculation.

Input: 
Your solution will receive three valid parameters. The methods that 
expect parameters will be tested with valid input.

Output:
Return an object as described above. The methods of the object 
modify the object and don't return anything.
