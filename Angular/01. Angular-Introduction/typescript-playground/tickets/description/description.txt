  Write a program using TS that manages a database of tickets. 
A ticket has a destination (string), a price (number) and a 
status (string). Your program will receive two arguments – the 
first is an array of strings for ticket descriptions and the 
second is a string, representing sorting criteria. The ticket 
descriptions have the following format:
<destinationName>|<price>|<status>
  Store each ticket and at the end of execution return a sorted 
summary of all tickets, sorted by either destination, price or 
status, depending on the second parameter that your program 
received. Always sort in ascending order (default behavior for 
alphabetical sort). If two tickets compare the same, use order 
of appearance. See the examples for more information.

Input :
Your program will receive two parameters – an array of strings and a single string.

Output :
Return a sorted array of all the tickets that where registered.
